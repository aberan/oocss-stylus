oocss-stylus
============

A fork of https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki/Grids.

Trimmed out all non-necessary fat to use the base for a build system designed specifically for stylus instead of scss and removed all components functionality.

Removed vagrant and instead uses <a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html">MAMP</a> (installed separately) to run localhost.
